The vulnerability occurs when parsing specially\n          crafted MP4 files. While a wide variety of remote attack vectors exist, this\n          particular exploit is designed to work within an HTML5 compliant browser.\n\n          Exploitation is done by supplying a specially crafted MP4 file with two\n          tx3g atoms that, when their sizes are summed, cause an integer overflow when\n          processing the second atom. As a result, a temporary buffer is allocated\n          with insufficient size and a memcpy call leads to a heap overflow.\n\n          This version of the exploit uses a two-stage information leak based on\n          corrupting the MetaData that the browser reads from mediaserver. This method\n          is based on a technique published in NorthBit's Metaphor paper. First,\n          we use a variant of their technique to read the address of a heap buffer\n          located adjacent to a SampleIterator object as the video HTML element's\n          videoHeight. Next, we read the vtable pointer from an empty Vector within\n          the SampleIterator object using the video element's duration. This gives\n          us a code address that we can use to determine the base address of\n          libstagefright and construct a ROP chain dynamically.\n\n          NOTE: the mediaserver process on many Android devices (Nexus, for example) is\n          constrained by SELinux and thus cannot use the execve system call. To avoid\n          this problem, the original exploit uses a kernel exploit payload that disables\n          SELinux and spawns a shell as root. Work is underway to make the framework\n          more amenable to these types of situations. Until that work is complete, this\n          exploit will only yield a shell on devices without SELinux or with SELinux in\n          permissive mode.",

This can be leveraged to create a dummy image containing malicious PHP code using the\n          Imagick constructor class delivering a webshell that can be accessed by the attacker, thereby executing the\n          malicious PHP code and gaining access to the system.\n\n          Because of this, any remote attacker, without authentication, can exploit this vulnerability to gain\n          access to the underlying operating system as the user that the web services are running as (typically www-data).",

By sending a specially crafted message, an attacker can corrupt the\n          heap and execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the Exim daemon.\n\n          The root cause is that no check is made to ensure that the buffer is not full\n          prior to handling '%s' format specifiers within the 'string_vformat' function.\n          In order to trigger this issue, we get our message rejected by sending a message\n          that is too large. This will call into log_write to log rejection headers (which\n          is a default configuration setting). After filling the buffer, a long header\n          string is sent. In a successful attempt, it overwrites the ACL for the 'MAIL\n          FROM' command. By sending a second message, the string we sent will be evaluated\n          with 'expand_string' and arbitrary shell commands can be executed.\n\n          It is likely that this issue could also be exploited using other techniques such\n          as targeting in-band heap management structures, or perhaps even function pointers\n          stored in the heap.

Therefore, there was a 2 year lag time\n          between when the issue was fixed and when it was discovered being exploited\n          in the wild. At that point, the issue was assigned a CVE and began being\n          addressed by downstream vendors.\n\n          An additional vulnerability, CVE-2010-4345, was also used in the attack that\n          led to the discovery of danger of this bug.

The application will first check if 'Profile' header exists and appends\n          a dot with the next parameter within the file. It will then measure the character length\n          of the header by calling strcspn with a dot as its null-terminated character.\n\n          It will then write the header into memory and ensure the header ends with a NUL character.\n          The parameter character array is passed to the strcpy() function.

It is packaged in several products or GE, such as\n          Proficy Historian 4.5, 4.0, 3.5, and 3.1, Proficy HMI/SCADA 5.1 and 5.0, Proficy\n          Pulse 1.0, Proficy Batch Execution 5.6, and SI7 I/O Driver between 7.20 and 7.42.\n          When the control is installed with these products, the function \"LaunchTriPane\"\n          will use ShellExecute to launch \"hh.exe\", with user controlled data as parameters.\n          Because of this, the \"-decompile\" option can be abused to write arbitrary files on\n          the remote system.\n\n          Code execution can be achieved by first uploading the payload to the remote\n          machine, and then upload another mof file, which enables Windows Management\n          Instrumentation service to execute it. Please note that this module currently only\n          works for Windows before Vista.\n\n          On the other hand, the target host must have the WebClient service (WebDAV\n          Mini-Redirector) enabled. It is enabled and automatically started by default on\n          Windows XP SP3",

To set up the appropriate buggy conditions, we first craft\n          the DOM tree in a specific order, where a CBlockElement comes after the CTextArea element.\n          If we use a select() function for the CTextArea element, two important things will happen:\n          a CDisplayPointer object will be created for CTextArea, and it will also trigger another\n          event called \"onselect\".

An attacker first can setup two elements, where the second\n          is the child of the first, and then setup a onlosecapture event handler for the parent\n          element.

The 32-bit register will run out of storage space to\n          represent the large value, which ends up being 0, but it still gets pushed as a\n          dwBytes argument (size) for a HeapAlloc call.

Platforms such as Windows\n          Vista SP2 all the way to Windows 8, Windows Server 2008 and 2012 are known to be\n          vulnerable. However, based on our testing, the most reliable setup is on Windows platforms\n          running Office 2013 and Office 2010 SP2. And please keep in mind that some other setups such\n          as using Office 2010 SP1 might be less stable, and sometimes may end up with a crash due to\n          a failure in the CPackage::CreateTempFileName function.\n\n          This module will generate three files: an INF, a GIF, and a PPSX file. You are required to\n          set up a SMB or Samba 3 server and host the INF and GIF there. Systems such as Ubuntu or an\n          older version of Windows (such as XP) work best for this because they require little\n          configuration to get going. The PPSX file is what you should send to your target.\n\n          In detail, the vulnerability has to do with how the Object Packager 2 component\n          (packager.dll) handles an INF file that contains malicious registry changes, which may be\n          leveraged for code execution. First of all, Packager does not load the INF file directly.\n          As an attacker, you can trick it to load your INF anyway by embedding the file path as\n          a remote share in an OLE object. The packager will then treat it as a type of media file,\n          and load it with the packager!CPackage::OLE2MPlayerReadFromStream function, which will\n          download it with a CopyFileW call, save it in a temp folder, and pass that information for\n          later. The exploit will do this loading process twice: first for a fake gif file that's\n          actually the payload, and the second for the INF file.\n\n          The packager will also look at each OLE object's XML Presentation Command, specifically the\n          type and cmd property. In the exploit, \"verb\" media command type is used, and this triggers\n          the packager!CPackage::DoVerb function. Also, \"-3\" is used as the fake gif file's cmd\n          property, and \"3\" is used for the INF. When the cmd is \"-3\", DoVerb will bail. But when \"3\"\n          is used (again, for the INF file), it will cause the packager to try to find appropriate\n          handler for it, which will end up with C:\\Windows\\System32\\infDefaultInstall.exe, and that\n          will install/run the malicious INF file, and finally give us arbitrary code execution.",

    "description": "This module exploits a stack-based buffer overflow in versions 1.2 through\n          1.3.0 of ProFTPD server. The vulnerability is within the \"sreplace\" function\n          within the \"src/support.c\" file.\n\n          The off-by-one heap overflow bug in the ProFTPD sreplace function has been\n          discovered about 2 (two) years ago by Evgeny Legerov. We tried to exploit\n          this off-by-one bug via MKD command, but failed. We did not work on this bug\n          since then.\n\n          Actually, there are exists at least two bugs in sreplace function, one is the\n          mentioned off-by-one heap overflow bug the other is a stack-based buffer overflow\n          via 'sstrncpy(dst,src,negative argument)'.\n\n          We were unable to reach the \"sreplace\" stack bug on ProFTPD 1.2.10 stable\n          version, but the version 1.3.0rc3 introduced some interesting changes, among them:\n\n          1. another (integer) overflow in sreplace!\n          2. now it is possible to reach sreplace stack-based buffer overflow bug via\n          the \"pr_display_file\" function!\n          3. stupid '.message' file display bug\n\n          So we decided to choose ProFTPD 1.3.0 as a target for our exploit.\n          To reach the bug, you need to upload a specially created .message file to a\n          writeable directory, then do \"CWD <writeable directory>\" to trigger the invocation\n          of sreplace function.\n\n          Note that ProFTPD 1.3.0rc3 has introduced a stupid bug: to display '.message'\n          file you also have to upload a file named '250'. ProFTPD 1.3.0 fixes this bug.\n\n          The exploit is a part of VulnDisco Pack since Dec 2005.",

The exploit uses the Upload Theme\n          functionality to upload a zip file containing the payload.

The first fix for this vulnerability appeared in version 2.6.7,\n          but the fix can be bypassed. In PHP's default configuration,\n          a POST variable overwrites a GET variable in the $_REQUEST array. The plugin\n          uses $_REQUEST to check for access rights. By setting the POST parameter to\n          something not beginning with 'wysija_', the check is bypassed. Wordpress uses\n          the $_GET array to determine the page, so it is not affected by this. The developers\n          applied the fixes to all previous versions too.",
